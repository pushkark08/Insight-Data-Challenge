# Insight-Data-Challenge

This is my submission for the Insight data challenge.
I have used Python 2.7 for this challenge.
I used Min Heap and Max Heap to get the running median for the first part. I have used the heapq library for this purpose.
In the second part, I maintained an array which I sort and take the middle element to find the median at the end.
